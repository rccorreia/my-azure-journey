# Azure

This material is compiled from numerous sources. I tried to compile every source in my [Sources](sources.md) file. Every Time I had doubts I went to google and then tried to write the explanation here.

## Fundamentals

Azure provides Cloud-Based services for anyone to consume and build solutions and host then without needing local infraestructure.

To access these services you'll need an [account](Fundamentals/account.md).

Inside your account, you can have [subscriptions](Fundamentals/subscription.md).

These subscriptions may contain [resources](Fundamentals/resource.md).
