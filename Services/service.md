# Service

## IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

In this model, the user is responsable to manage the compute and networking resources inside Microsoft Azure. For example, Windows updates in your virtual machines must be done by the user manually.

Virtual Machines are an example of IaaS service.

### Why would we choose IaaS?

We need to choose IaaS if we need/want control over the operating system. That's basically it. If we want to install any required platform that PaaS doesn't gives option, or want to manage data, runtime and middlewares, we need to choose IaaS. 

## PaaS - Plataform as a Service

In this model, we are consuming the resource without having to mantain the operating system, for example. The OS updates are made automatically, by the cloud provider.

### Why would we choose PaaS?

We choose PaaS if we don't want to maintain servers and databases and we don't have to. The Azure will take care of this for us. 

## Service Availability

When a new service is created, it is available in one chosen region and then, in time, becomes available in another regions. So if you want a service, check out if it is available in the region you choose.
