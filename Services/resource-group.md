# Resource Group

This service gives us the ability to:

- Group Resources

With Resource Group you can group resources of an solution together.

- Build template deployments

They describe our solution and can be re-used to every deploy.

- Consistent management layer and tooling

You can manage your resources and resource groups by tools and code, automating your infraestructure deploy, for example.

- Security boundary

We can define groups of resources and estabilish the control of these to a certain user or group of users that will admin these resources.

- Billing grouping

You can see the cost to maintain the group of resources that define your solution and assigne the billing to a business group inside our organization, for example.
