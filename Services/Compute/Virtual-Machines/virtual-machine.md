# Virtual Machine

They are scalable compute resources. Azure allows us to choose the size of RAM, CPU power and disk resources, also the number of virtual machines we want to start at the same time. You can programme to start a high number of virtual machines to support your operation during the day and stop all of them or maintain only a minimal number during the night, where a small amount of usage is needed.

We get to consume the operating system along with the VM. So, whenever we choose Linux or Windows, is up to us to install our apps and maintain the OS updated.

## Why would we choose Virtual Machines?

We need to choose Virtual Machines if we need/want control over the operating system. The itens above will be our responsable:

- Patching;
- Version control (of the system and other apps);
- Intrumentation (middlewares);
- Security/Compliance.

## Images (Azure Marketplace Images)

A collection of prepackaged applications, platforms or services provided by Microsoft and/or third parties.

We can choose between:

- Operating Systens versions (Linux, Windows and versions inside the chosen OS);
- Application infrastructure (Third parties images);
- Custom images (Images created by us or our enterprise).
