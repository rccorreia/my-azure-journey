# Azure Regions

We say Azure is cloud-based but essentially every data must be on a data center. Azure have several data centers world wide.

A region is a set of these data centers deployed. They have a low latency between data centers inside their regions.

Every [resource](resource.md) must be placed inside an Azure Region.

You can see a list of Azure Regions [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/).
