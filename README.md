# my-azure-journey

A repo for my study material, example code and important topics summary.

This repo was created in March 2019 and maintained from then on. Some content in this repo don't work like specified here anymore, but it may be a nice start. As we know, Azure Portal is changing very fast for the better and maybe you can't even find the options on the menu, or even the menu itself, that I am specifying in this document. So please search in google for azure updates in its portal if you can't reproduce the steps written in this repository.

You can start [here](summary.md)
